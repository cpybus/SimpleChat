# IT IS FOR EXPLANATION AND DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES ONLY.
# IN THIS FILE, THE MEANINGS OF ALL THE DIFFERENT VARIABLES
# WILL BE EXPLAINED TO YOU.


# Each of these sections provides a different use/function.
# I highly recommend reading through the commented section
# before you start assigning values to things.

# When I made this plugin, I understood that certain server
# owners didnt need some of these features, so I added a 
# "use" variable to each section. By default, all are set to
# true. But, if you dont not require a certain section, feel
# free to set it to false. 

# All the explanations below are assuming that the respective
# section if set to true.

# The <onlineplayers> variable on this one can be a little tricky...
# The syntax is: <onlineplayers:playernamecolor,commacolor,group>
# The greater/less than signs are required at the beginning and
# end of the variable.

# It can be used in any of the following ways:
#   <onlineplayers:&4,&c,Admin> - this will make names dark red (&4), commas light red (&c), and only display the admin group.
#   <onlineplayers:&1,&7> - this will make names dark blue (&1) and commas gray (&7). It will display everyone because no group was specified.
#   <onlineplayers> - this is display all players, and it will all be white, because no colors were specified.
#   <onlineplayers:&e,&8,default> - this is make names yellow (&e), commas dark gray (&8), and only players from the default group.
